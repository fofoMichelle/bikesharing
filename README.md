# BikeSharing
# Overview & Purpose
The task at hand was to analyze the Citibike NYC data for the month of August and put together a "proof of concept" business proposal for the Des Moines, Iowa area.
Our purpose is to create an analysis on the Citibike Bikesharing from NYC and help investors decide whether this is a business worth investing in.
We created a visualizations on Tableau using workssheets, dashboards and stories. Please [click here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/michelle.ayinkamiye/viz/NYCAnalysis5/NYCBikeStory?publish=yes) to see stories created.

# Results:

## Checkout times for Users

With this graphs we are able to visualize that most people prefer to ride bikes for 5 minutes and no one is riding for more than an hour which is quite understandable considering the effort used to ride a bike and the weather in NYC

## Checkout time by Gender 

Majority of the customers are men and they also have a higher trip duration which means that they might be most profitable for the business.

Weekends seem to be the the busiest days with the most busiest hours being the rush hours.

## User trip by Gender by Weekday.

Subscribers tend to use bikes during weekdays whereas customers use it during weekends. This can be explained by the fact that most subscribers use the ride shares to go to work whereas the customers tend to rent a bike to relax during the weekend

As we will see with the next visualizations men use the most the ride shares compared to women. They sare more unkown users  among customers than subscribers  which might lead us to believe that these are travelers who are not interrested in providing demographic informations.

## Trips by Gender

Majority of users are men and the demand for bikes are on weekdays.Trends are showing that most unkown users prefer weekends which might be explained by the fact that they are travellers who do not want to share their demographic info on the app

## Top Starting Location

According to this map the most populous locations in New York  have are the top starting locations with towns like Brooklyn, Queens having the most ride shares 

# Gender Breakdown

The pie is self explanatory there more men who uses th the service of bike sharing share which is a bit understandable considering the safeness of the practise most women would rather drive than ride a bicycle.

# Gender Breakdown and Checkout Times by Gender

I used this to show the correlation between the checkoutimes by Gender and gender breakdown. Men not only are they are the ones using the bikes the most they also spend more time using the bike which means that if one was to do a marketing compain we would need to focus on the most profitable gender.

# Summary
The New York city bike sharing data analysis indicates a high probability of a success story if a similar business was to be opened in Des Moines.
The bike sharing service is in high demand especially during summer due to the weather conditions. The service is also mostly used by men.
Additionnal visualizations for future analysis would include the following:

- Performance of the service in other months to determine the overall profitability, this might require a new set of data but would be very useful when deciding about the profitability of the business.

- A new visualization on trips by weekday which would focus on the the trips by weekdays only with emphasis on the traffic hours as this might be the most lucrative time for this business
